# parm-totoriko
Tiny ARM Cortex-M0 simulation using logisim.

In the logisim-project directory, you will find all of our logisim files for the microprocessor, but also all the unit testing files that are available for our components.

You can find a parser in the src/main directory. It converts ARM Thumb instructions into hexadecimal that can directly be read by Logisim.

Finally, in this repository, the presentation file we used for our oral examination can also be found.
